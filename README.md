# Jammming

Codecademy project for the "Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch" course.

## Description

I decided to build this myself, only using the description on the main project page. I'm sure it's imperfect, so I'm
really interested in feedback.

## Setup

Change `clientId` in `src/util/Spotify.js`, then run:

```
yarn install
yarn run
```
